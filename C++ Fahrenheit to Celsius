//Write a C++ program to convert degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. Your program should read in the number from standard input, and output the result of the conversion to standard output.
//The formula for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius is: Tc = (Tf-32)*5/9
//where Tf is the reading in Fahrenheit, and Tc is the desired Celsius result.
