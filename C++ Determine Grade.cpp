//In this task, we will write a program to determine the letter grade given a integer between 0 and 100.
//The program should ask the user to input an integer, and print one of the following statements:
//"A": if the integer is between 90 and 100.
//"B": if the integer is between 80 and 89.
//"C": if the integer is between 70 and 79.
//"D": if the integer is between 60 and 69.
//"F": if the integer is between 0 and 59.
//"Invalid mark.": if the integer is a negative, or greater than 100.
